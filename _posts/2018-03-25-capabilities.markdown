To build beyond compromise. Sometimes it means being in the business of the impossible.

A lavish indoor swimming pool created below sea level in Greenwich. A 25-car subterranean garage hidden  ingeniously beneath a tree-lined drive, accessible only by a hidden entrance. An astonishing “Transforming Art Wall” with 24 computer-controlled positions, displaying a changeable rotation of paintings and sculptures. A South Hampton mansion doubling in size on an unprecedented timetable between Labor Day and Memorial Day. A team of Italian painters moved to Greenwich for two years to create murals and gilding worthy of Michelangelo for a re-built chateau. A house on the coast where the floor-to-ceiling windows, crafted from 3-inch thick hurricane grade glass, stretches up to an astonishing nineteen feet. And historic restorations mandating global hunts for rare antique trim, moss-covered roof tiles, historically accurate stone, exotic woods and one-of-a-kind ornamental plastering.

Sometimes building beyond compromise means having two large woodworking mills and the region’s finest finishing company situated within our own company. It means an army of craftspeople on staff – plasterers, painters, carpenters and stone masons many of whom learned their trades with European masters. Nine house detailers who can create a breathtaking period environment from a single reference photograph. And specialists in drafting, engineering and integrated computer control systems on permanent staff.

Mostly, to build beyond compromise means no estate is too big and no detail is too small to receive Xhema perfection.
