![Lavish Homes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/jones/jones-C-1.jpg){: .callout}

They are the lavish homes and historic townhouses that inspire awe and grace the pages of glossy magazines. They are visions in stone and steel, glass and exotic woods, brought to us by distinguished architects and designers.

They are an elite collection of the world’s legendary homes, and they only exist because there is a certain type of builder – a builder with an ingeniousness of craft, an uncompromising vision of perfection, and a near obsession with detail.

Such a builder is Xhema, hailed by Town & Country as one of the seven best builders of luxury homes in America. For over forty years, opulent residences and historically restored townhouses in New York and  Connecticut bear witness to the zeal and meticulous craftsmanship of Xhema construction.

To the flawless execution of architectural designs, Xhema brings a total suite of construction services, a  fully-integrated, permanently-staffed, all-inclusive building company that assures perfection from breaking  ground to the final detail.
